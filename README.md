# Analysis of Interplanetary Conditions and Geomagnetic Variability

This project focuses on understanding the relationship between solar activity and geomagnetic conditions on Earth. The work involves:

Data Analysis: Examined interplanetary conditions and geomagnetic data through visual graph comparison to identify trends and anomalies.

Magnetic Corroboration: Explored techniques and applications of magnetic corroboration in geomagnetic studies.

Storm Investigation: Investigated geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind interactions with Earth's magnetosphere.

Atmospheric Correlation: Analyzed how variations in terrestrial atmospheric conditions correlate with solar activity.

The study aims to provide insights into space-weather phenomena and their terrestrial impacts.
