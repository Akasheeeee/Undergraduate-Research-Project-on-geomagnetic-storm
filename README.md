# Analysis of Interplanetary Conditions and Geomagnetic Variability

This project explores the relationship between solar activity and Earth’s geomagnetic environment. The study involves analyzing interplanetary conditions and geomagnetic data through visual graph comparisons to identify key patterns and anomalies. It examines the concept of magnetic corroboration and its role in geomagnetic research, investigates geomagnetic storms triggered by solar wind interactions, and assesses the correlation between terrestrial atmospheric variations and solar activity. The findings aim to enhance our understanding of space-weather phenomena and their potential impacts on Earth’s environment.
