# Analysis of Interplanetary Conditions and Geomagnetic Variability

This project explores the relationship between solar activity and Earth’s geomagnetic environment using observational data obtained from NASA. The analysis involves studying interplanetary conditions and geomagnetic data through visual graph comparisons created with Origin software to identify significant patterns and anomalies. The work further examines the concept of magnetic corroboration and its applications in geomagnetic research, investigates geomagnetic storms triggered by solar wind interactions, and evaluates the correlation between terrestrial atmospheric variations and solar activity. These insights contribute to a better understanding of space-weather phenomena and their potential impact on Earth’s systems.
